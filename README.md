Hello I am bingo0507 and I am a senior Fullstack developer and AI developer.
Being an IT engineer by education, I always worked in software development, electronic engineering, and businesses around information technologies.

I know everything about nothing :)

🔎 I’m looking to collaborate on commercial projects and startups
❤️ I prefer React with Material UI on frontend and NestJS with MongoDB and/or PostgreSQL on backend
💬 Feel free to ask me about everything
📗 I worked for Upwork - NASDAQ:UPWK
💰 I worked for Deel - 12x 🦄 Startup
📺 I worked for Restream - 🦄 Startup
🏆 Fun fact: I'm back to engineering after 12 years of business career 😉
